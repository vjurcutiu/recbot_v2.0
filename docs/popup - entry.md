# Popup Main Entry Point Documentation

This document explains the main entry point for the popup, which provides the user interface for interacting with the extension. The entry point is defined in two key files: `index.html` and `popup.js`.

## index.html

**Purpose:**  
This file serves as the HTML shell for the popup interface. It defines the basic structure and includes a container for rendering dynamic content, as well as a start button that users click to initiate actions.

**Key Elements:**
- `<div id="root"></div>`: A container element where the popup’s UI components may be dynamically rendered.
- `<button id="start-button">Start</button>`: A button that, when clicked, triggers the start process.
- `<script type="module" src="popup.js"></script>`: Loads the `popup.js` module to attach event listeners and handle interactions.

## popup.js

**Purpose:**  
This module handles the popup’s interactive behavior. It listens for the document to be fully loaded and then attaches a click event listener to the start button.

**Key Functions:**
- When the start button is clicked, the script sends a message to the background script to update the active component to `Start`.
- After setting the active component, it sends a subsequent message to request that a new window is opened for the main UI.
- The script handles any errors during these messaging operations and logs the responses for debugging purposes.

**Workflow:**
1. Wait for the DOM content to load.
2. Select the start button using its ID.
3. Attach a click event listener that:
   - Sends a message to update the active component.
   - Upon response (or error), sends another message to open a new window.
   - Logs the results of both actions for troubleshooting.

Together, these files form the entry point for the popup, allowing users to initiate interactions that are then processed by the background script and other parts of the extension’s interface.
